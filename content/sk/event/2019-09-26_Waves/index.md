__Quoted from the conference agenda:__

CEEMID – Central & Eastern European Music Databases was created out of necessity: many Central and Eastern European countries are lacking effective cross-industry or governmental statistics on music or on cultural industries in general. The lack of data makes the work of tour planning, record promotion, grant evaluation or royalty tariff setting very difficult in those countries where the need would be even greater for such activities than in the most advanced markets.

Musicians are the most known source of information

Daniel Antal developed a survey distributed among music professionals asking them about their experience. These surveys were designed to fill the gaps in the data collection of official statistics and other music and film industry sources. The first survey was made in 2014 in Hungary, and in 2019 it already included 11 countries. They had been filled out in the past years by more than 5000 creative industry professional, in 2019 in Austria, too.

Daniel Antal believes that the music business in most of Europe, including Austria, has many common, similar challenges and would need a lot more regional cooperation to solve them. With the CEEMID-report, presented at the Waves Vienna Conference. Daniel Antal gives a fact-based comparison and will suggest some possible policy and strategic solutions to be debated after.

abstract: "Streaming services account for 62% of global recorded music revenue, making them by far the most popular medium for listeners. Digital revenue has been steadily increasing, mainly due to subscriptions and ad-supported streams, but low margins for artists and musicians mean this is just not enough. There is a need to rethink a fairer, more sustainable streaming business model, starting with the role of DSPs, catalog management and intellectual property rights. How can streaming economies be a real source of revenue for artists? What aspects matter most within these economies?"

1.	Artists in the UK had a difficulty explaining in Westminster how they are losing out in streaming, so we have created a streaming price index, like the Dow Jones, if you like, that explains the economic factors of the devaluation of music in the last 5 years in 20 countries. (See [our report](https://music.dataobservatory.eu/publication/mce_empirical_streaming_2021/).)

2.	Music organizations in Slovakia and Hungary were frustrated that their politicians and journalists believed music to be taxpayer funded, so we showed with data that they contribute more proportionally to the national budget than car manufacturers, the darling of local politicians (See our reports in [Hungary](https://music.dataobservatory.eu/publication/hungary_music_industry_2014/) (recast several times) and in [Slovakia](https://music.dataobservatory.eu/publication/slovak_music_industry_2019/).)

3.	We successfully challenged with data restaurant associations, hotel chains, telecom corporations and broadcasters who wanted to bring music prices down in court and via lobbying.

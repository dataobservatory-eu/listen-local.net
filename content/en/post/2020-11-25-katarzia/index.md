Katarzia, or *Katarína Kubošiová*, is a Slovak singer, lyricist and producer. In 2020 she released her fourth album [Celibát](https://www.slnkorecords.sk/en/katarzia/celibat) with the main themes of loneliness and self-appreciation. Album was created in collaboration with the producer *Jonatán Pastirčák*. 

Katarzia started her career as a folk singer. In the past years she moved on towards electronic music. She describes her current sound can as a mix of folk and electropop. The tour to promote her newest album *Celibát* had been planned for spring 2020, unfortunately due to the Covid-19 pandemic had to be postponed indefinitely. As many other artists, Katarzia thinks that the current situation is not easy.

*At the moment, I am not working on any new projects. I am looking for a new job. Once the pandemic is over, I would like to stay where I am now, and return to the clubs to play for my audience. As I sing in Slovak, I know where my place is – I don't want to perform abroad, of course, unless I turn to techno music. On a more personal level, I would like to live in New York – not as a musician, tough.*

Katarzia is originally from Nitra, Slovakia and she has been living in Prague for a couple of years. 

*I live in Dejvice – there is a nice clubroom there, but I don't visit that much. I enjoy going to National Theatre, Dejvice Theatre, Meetfactory, Archa Theatre and Rudolfinum. All the old classics.*

Despite the restrictions during the pandemic, Katarzia managed to shoot a video for her song *Hoří i voda* from *Celibát*.

The music video is a short film, directed by Jay Walker, an American who lives and works in Prague. [Girls in film](http://girlsinfilm.net/network) –- an organization that supports women in the film industry –- participated in the production of the video. The song is about women rights and equality.

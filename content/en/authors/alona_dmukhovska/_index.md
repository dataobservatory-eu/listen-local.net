Alona works in the music industry for almost a decade. Starting as a volunteer for the music festival she soon grew to the position of program director taking care of 100+ acts performing the biggest festival stages in Ukraine. She believes in the power of education and networking having done the music exchange projects in Germany, the Netherlands, the Czech Republic, and even in the Middle East (Kyrgyzstan, hello!). 

Along with her co-founder Alone started [Music Export Ukraine](https://musicexportukraine.com/), an independent organisation that helps Ukrainian artists build international careers. Since then, she showcased local talents at professional events in more than 20 countries, lobbied sector needs in Ukraine and Europe, did dozens of international projects, became the expert in European funding. And strangely, she still enjoys music!

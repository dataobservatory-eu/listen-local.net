Listen Local is an open collaboration for artists, fans, managers, developers to provide alternatives to connect local audiences with local artists through locally relevant music recommendations and findings. As a project of the Digital Music Observatory it aims to make big data work for small labels and self-released artists, and to make algorithms work for and not against them.

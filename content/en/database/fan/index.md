**Do you know a great band that we haven't heard of yet? Do you have a new band ðŸ¤«? If you want it to be recommended on global streaming platforms to fans, or for visitors in your region, you want to help them so that we can find them new audiences locally and abroad -- please, let us know about them**

The `write-in database` is managed by the `Listen Local System` and its curators. It collects and organizes data already available on the internet and in certain databases about songs (recordings), compositions (works), and artists (as composers or performers, including solo artists, bands, ensembles, and other formations.) We synchronize the write-in databases with reliable global data sources. Our curators verify and correct data in the write-in databases.

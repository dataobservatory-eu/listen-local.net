The LaLa opt-in database is managed by the `Listen Local` and curators and the service development team.  It empowers artists, or their authorized managers (artist managers or labels or publishers) to see what information is already available about the artist in various databases and internet sources, and to empower the artist to make corrections.  The primary aim of the opt-in database to make sure that algorithms which give visibility for the artist and manage payments for the use of the artistâ€™s work perform these tasks seamlessly.  The opt-in database fuels our services that connect the audience to new, relevant audiences and reveals new geographical and cultural market segments.

In July 2020, Professor Paul Carr was commissioned by [Senedd Research](https://senedd.wales/en/bus-home/research/Pages/research.aspx) to document a report examining the ‘state of play’ in the post Covid-19 music industries in Wales. This resultant document outlines the contextual backstory of the emergence of private and public sector support for the music industries in Wales since the pandemic commenced; examines the advice given to the music industries by the UK and Welsh Governments concerning roadmaps out of the pandemic; reviews the industry and academic research that has emerged since the pandemic started and finally, compares Welsh Government support packages tonations in other parts of the world. 

Although the report considers the Welsh music industries more broadly, its primary focus is on live music, as it is this which has been the recent concern of the [Culture, Welsh Language and Communications Committee](https://senedd.wales/en/bus-home/committees/Pages/Committee-Profile.aspx?cid=445). It is also this subsector that has been widely reported as being impacted the most by the pandemic. The report concludes by documenting a series of recommendations for the Culture, Welsh Language and Communications Committee to consider presenting to Welsh Government.

In order to give the reader a concise snapshot of details contained in the report the Executive Summery outlines the context of the Welsh industries pre and post Covid-19, prior to contextualising its recommendations, which are sub divided into the following six categories: Reopening and Recovery Strategies; Research; Strategic Opportunities and Promotion; Policy; Education; Funding.
